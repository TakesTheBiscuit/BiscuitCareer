    PreviousAlice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x PreviousAlice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->PreviousAlice: Checking with John...
    PreviousAlice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
